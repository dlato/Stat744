## Original Graph
The following homework assignment is about Jia Youâ€™s online graphic about vaccines which can be found
[here.](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/here-s-visual-proof-why-vaccines-do-more-good-harm)


## What question is this graphic trying to answer?
I believe that this graphic is trying to answer the question: Do vaccines work?
I think that the author is trying to show that after a vaccine has been licenced for a number of diseases, the number of reported cases (in the U.S.) decreases.
Hence, matching the title of the graphic that "visual proof of why vaccines do more good than harm".

## Create 2 new plots with the data
```{r read dat}
vac_dat <- read.csv("vaccine_data_online.csv")
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
