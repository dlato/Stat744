-4-5 plots
- dont want to really plots the same thing in different ways
- so 4-5 different plots that look at different things
- written part, justify why you did things this way, why your graphs think this way
- story telling part, and then maybe a behind the sceens part
- could be purly exploratory
- should ask if it actually is in partners or if we can do it alone...
